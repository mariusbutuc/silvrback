# Day to Day TL Practices

A panel discussion around the _[Day to Day TL Practices](https://www.meetup.com/Toronto-Software-Team-Lead-Meetup/events/237755638/)_ topic sparked tonight amongst the [#TeamLeadTO](https://www.meetup.com/Toronto-Software-Team-Lead-Meetup/) members:

> We each get through our everyday TL lives with our own bag of best practices, life hacks and mindful habits. We’ve collected those from books, blogs, mentors, and our own hard-earned experience.
>
> Now it’s time to share!
>
> We’ve gathered a small panel of folks with team lead experience to share some of the strategies they use to do their very best TLing.

## The Panel

In the order in which I was seeing them from my seat, the panel was composed of:

- Ofer Guttman - Director of Software Engineering, Points
- Luke Reeves - Developer Lead, Shopify
- Ash Christopher - Director of Engineering, Wave HQ
- Ania Halliop - Development Manager, Freshbooks
- Will Harford - Integrations Architect, Unata

## The Topics

The original plan was to as many of the following topics as we could

- How do you give positive/negative feedback?
- How do you deal with inter-team conflict?
- How do you run your one-on-ones?
- How do you deal with a frustrated person who reports to you?
- How do you deal with complaints from people who report to you about your superiors/the company?
- How do you deal with complaints about people who report to you from others in the company?
- How do you help your reports plan their career growth?
- How do you manage high performers vs low performers?
- How do you onboard new employees?

In the light of what happened about week ago, I wished I knew how other people handled issues like that. So I joined the meetup, went, and I even took notes.

## My notes

  - _Ash:_ Defensive versus heroic
  - _Ash:_ tactic versus strategy
  - _Will:_ People are not mathematical models. The sum of the inputs doesn't always equal the sum of the outputs.
  - _Ania:_ Trust — if you go in good faith, 99% of the people will match that. Similarly about respect.
  - one-on-ones
    - This is their time, not yours: you put yourself out there, be there to help them, let them own the conversation.
    - _Luke:_ Notebooks, no computers.
    - _How are you?_ versus _What's on your mind?_ Either as soon as you walked through the door, or since the beginning of the week.
    - What do you want to do in three years. *blank*
    - If you were to leave Freshbooks today, what would make you go?
    - _Luke:_ There is no book, no Wikipedia page on what to do in one-on-ones.
    - Ania wrote an internal handbook in mentoring, one-on-ones etc.
  - Performance
    - _Luke:_ What is your impact? How do you make it broader?
    - Anonymous feedback: How is your manager doing?
    - Low hanging fruit.
      1. Be clear with your expectations.
      2. Document them. Easy to come back and keep track.
    - How do you define a performance metric?
  - _Paul:_ Experience working with someone with Asperger / autism
    - Very performant, maybe difficult to deal with socially.
    - In the majority of interviews, it's teamwork that is sought after.
    - Remote work? Not accepted in some companies.
    - Building rapport, safe to ask for help.
  - Depression, social anxiety, mental health
    - Build a safe environment.
    - _James W:_ employee assistance program (EAP).
  - _Ania:_ the [Turn the ship around](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00AFPVP0Y/) book
  - _Ash:_ Humility is a very heroic human trait


David Marquet's book, plus many of the topics that were touced, they all remind me of this article about [creating not a sense of urgency, but fostering a sense of purpose instead](https://medium.com/@kimber_lockhart/don-t-create-a-sense-of-urgency-foster-a-sense-of-purpose-724e309ecdb0).

These were my notes on Day to Day team leading practice. And yes, it’s time to share! Which practices managed to catch your attention?
