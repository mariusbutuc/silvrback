Heard of **[Clojure][clojure]**? Wanted to, or tried it out already? Eager to better understand its _idiomatic_ ways?

The [Clojure Toronto][clojure-to] group is kickstarting the **[Clojure workshop for beginners][clojure-beginner]** with the first session this Saturday, March 7, from 1pm.

The plan is to meet up every Saturday afternoon at [the Shopify office][shopify-hq] and dive into Clojure with open, beginner minds. We will start diving into Clojure's idiomatic functional approach while at the same time introducing the basic syntax.
There are no heavyweight prerequisites.

This first round of the workshop will be taught by [Dmitri Sotnikov][dmitri] based on the excellent [Clojure Distilled][clojure-distilled], of which he is also the author.

I look forward to seeing you on Saturday!
