# I can sleep when the wind blows

Stumbled tonight on [Kent Beck's keynote from RailsConf 2015][video] on the streetcar, on my way back from work, after a few weeks that have been _less comfortable_. A few weeks when the feeling that there is a massive "oportunity for improvement" was just starring me in the face, but I was too focused on that one thing I was doing to be able to extract something actionable out of it.

> A man cannot be comfortable without his own approval.
> —Mark Twain

I remember first watching it back in April. More than half year after, watching it again felt like it was watched only for the first time: the experiences lived in the ~6&nbsp;months in between enabled much more insight to be drawn from it.

Kent Beck builds his talk around

> how uncomfortable I feel at work

and the techniques he discovered through more than ten years of introspection and observation, actively working on attaining a sense of _ease_ at work. This sense of ease, he describes in the positive sense of facility, comfort, and freedom from anxiety.

One comment identifies Beck's talk  as _pure emotional intelligence_: it's so rich in teachings, that I sat down again, with my screen shared between the recording of the keynote and an sublime text window to take notes, while watching it for the third time. The [video][] of the talk is public, so if you haven't watched it yet, I can't recommend it enough. This short intro is the only "original" content you'll find here. Below are the notes I took to internalize the ideas better. They are also finding a home here so that they can _serve_ as future reference.

Keep in mind that all of them are direct quotes:

  * most of them are extracted here out of context,
  * such that some of them might even be contradicting,
  * I am _accountable_ for any typos or rephrasing gone wrong. :)

---

## Ease
  * State of comfort
    * I am where I should be, doing what I should be
    * Free from the nagging feeling that always is on the back of my mind,
      that I really ought to be doing something else

  * Freedom from worry, pain, or agitation
    * the programmer's life can be filled with anxiety

  * Readiness in performance, feeling of facility
    * athletes that make it look effortless
    * no extra motion in what they are doing
    * using a tool that I really understand well
    * working on a team that I have strong relationships with

## 1. My work matters
  * one of the big minuses of the virtual world that we, as programmers, work in is that you can't touch what we do.
  * features you're not sure anyone will ever use, or refactorings etc.
  * when in doubt, go find out!
    * ask questions
    * perform experiments
    * measure stuff, to make sure that my work matters
    * similar to lean startup
    * before you dive in, invest the time to go and find out
    * that nagging feeling when I'm going home at night _"did that really work?"_—that's a choice!
    * choose to work in such a way that I know that my code works
      * if I don't feel confident that my code works, I should work in a different way.
      * if you're confident that your code works, then ship it. And if you're not confident that your code works, then get confident that your code works… and then ship it!

## 2. I'm proud of my work
  * some engineering management treats engineers as robots
  * one of the basic human needs is the need to feel proud of what you do
  * this might be a reason to push refactoring a little bit earlier
  * _just in time refactoring_: just before I need to make a change, refactor to make the change easy, then make the easy change
  * increases the sense of accomplishment: _"Yeah, this code is as good as it makes sense to make it right now."_
  * work on a system untill I feel proud of it.
  * emotions are valuable information

## 3. I trust my curiosity
  * learning to trust your own sense of curiosity
  * ideas are like little mice
  * losing self-confidence: _"somebody is certain to have thought about that already"_, or _"I probably do not have time to follow that up"_
  * consciously encourage your own ideas, _"I'll take a half hour to figure out if the data supports this hypothesis"_
  * the quicker you become at vetting ideas, the more ideas come pouring out
  * when I'm scaring the mice back in the walls all the time
    * I just feel terrible
    * there is this whole world of things that I could explore, that I could lean about, but I'm just blowing them off, because I'm so focused, and I'm so busy on doing this one thing, that I have no slack to pursue other ideas

## 4. I make public commitments
  * trolling the first 10 years
    * never give an estimate
    * if you have to give an estimate, then maybe make an estimate about when you'll have the estimate ready
    * try to burry any numbers that you produce so deep that nobody ever figures out to find them
    * and you can't ever be called to account
  * estimates for finishing features is a loose
  * you can make public commitments towards shared goals
    * reduce churn by 3%, and on this date we're going to measure and see if we actually did that
  * anxiety level goes down
  * sense of _purpose_ and _focus_ goes up

## 5. I am accountable
  * you render account to someone else
    * I did this and that experiment
    * I wasted two days pursuing this idea, that I really should have known better than to do
    * yeah, part of it was that I just screwed up
  * feels so clean
    * I know what I'm going to do
    * I'm not going to blame anybody else, not going to point any fingers
    * I'm only going to say here is what I did, the decisions I made, the activities, this is the account: this is how I spent the time.
    * somebody else's response to that… well, that's their response

## 6. I interpret feedback
  * Two opposite reactons: either
    * when somebody says something about me, I think that's about me
    * or I just ignore them
    * …and constantly swinging between these two poles
  * I'm no more awesome the moment after you said that than the moment before you said that; nothing's changed about me.
  * interpretting feedback keeps me off of _the genius-shithead rollercoaster_
  * interpretting feedback puts me at ease even in situations of conflict
  * if I remember to interpret, I can do closer to my best

## 7. I am a beginner
  * periodically become a beginner at something
  * does it feel good to be ranked beginner when you're used to understanding your tools? No!
  * it doesn't feel good in the moment, but I can remember that feeling and I can get confidence: _"I'm in a situation, I'm not comfortable, I don't feel any sense of mastery, but it's OK, I can get out of it: if I could learn about Haskell, I could certainly deal with this situation."_
  * consciously put myself in positions where I'm a beginner so that I feel uncomfortable. So I can remember that I can deal with the feeling of being uncomfortable _and still do a pretty good job_.

##8. I meditate
  * when I meditate, in the mornings, I'm one breath away from being OK. For the rest of the day.
  * when I'm too busy to do anything in the morning, I'm one breath away from complete and utter panic, for the rest of the day.
  * made it a habit, and it's made a big difference

## 9. I serve
  * the sense of service
  * do something for someone else, in a way that prevents me from getting any kind of reward or feedback, or props
  * just do something for somebody else, with no thought of anything coming back
  * the next thing that comes up in the work world, I'm going to be readier to take on

If you want to start working on one of these yourself, find a buddy and work on it together with somebody. Makes a huge, huge difference.

So one night, the farmer wakes up in the middle of the night, and…
