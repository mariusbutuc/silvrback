Tonight, the DevOps Toronto group met with [Bakh Inamov][bakh] from Chef to talk about [Automating your in infrastructure with Chef][meetup]. The two mentions of Chef in the previous sentence do mention different entities, since as I've learnt tonight, OpsCode has been rebranded as Chef for a while now.

The rough agenda soon turned into an open discussion on everything and anything Chef. From the big picture of the Chef ecosystem to specifics like how do you use Chef in AWS, how about on Windows or on Azure or Vagrant, how are the Chef client and server roles architected,and what are the strategies in use, security, Chef vs. Puppet or Antsy, does CFEngine still exist, and many more.

Tonight was also the first time I've heard about [chef-metal][metal], first from [Leons][leons] when he described some details on how it's used in an internal project at IBM, and then from Bakh, when it came up in the open discussion. Still, the question if anybody uses it in production was left arguably unanswered.

The [Chef Supermarket][supermarket] is another good piece of news. One of the best metrics of quickly eyeballing the quality of cookbook still seems to be the number of downloads. And if you still remember the Community, that the Supermarket now replaces, that counter was only incrementing everytime someone would actually click the download button. The Supermarket on the other hand plugs into every API call, and now tracks all the installs from both chef-client and chef-solo.
