## All work and no play makes Marius a dull boy

This is one comes somewhat complementary to the other articles that are mostly focused on either technical subjects or around team/company culture or craftsmanship.

So much more complementary as life tends so much more than work, than passions, than what you live, than what lives youâ€¦

## And there was light

This is one aims to be the beginning of a series about [reading][me-reading] and learning, yet still very much about growing. The galvanizing spark first came from [Xavier Noria's Reading][fxn-reading]. But what actually made it ignite was the flame coming from the candle lit for a good friend that no longer walks amongst us. This first book, was the book that she was reading last time we met in person, a bit more than a year ago.

## Progress: Finished

| Title | Authors   | Start | Comment |
| ----- | -------   | ----- | ------- |
| [Good&nbsp;Omens ![Good Omens book cover][book-cover]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Omens) | Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett | Nov 2015 | The second book (right after [Armada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armada_(novel))) that managed to be read from one cover to the other by me in many years. A comedy, a fantasy, but a good reminder that life is so much more than we manage, at any time, to imagine. |

Let the [reading][me-reading] begin!
